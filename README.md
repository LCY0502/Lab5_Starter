## Pt 3. Unit Testing with Jest
1. No, I would not use unit test to test the "message" feature. Because "message" feature encapsulated many components depending on the application like the style of the text, number of characters, supported langauges, etc. Those aspects of "message" are depending on the need and is not suitable for every "message". 

2. Yes, because "max length" is a absolute property of meesage that every message has a length.
